      <h2>Here is the time line of work week evolution</h2>
      <ul id="container-ul">
        <li><strong>Unknown date - XVIII Century:</strong> In the XVIII century, Denmark and France abolished slavery in their territories. In the XIX century, Great Britain and the United States did the same, and many other countries followed suit. And although slavery is officially prohibited in almost all nations in the world today, it is estimated that millions of people are still living in slavery around the world.</li>
        <li><strong>XVIII Century y XIX Century - XX Century:</strong> The work week covered 7 days a week, in other words, every day. A total of 82 hours per week, which is almost 12 hours per day. and child labor predominated.</li>
        <li><strong>1940:</strong> The 40-hour workweek is established in the USA. This means 8 hours a day with two days of rest per week.</li>
        <li><strong>XX Century:</strong> Most countries in Europe, as well as the USA and Canada, established a 40-hour workweek.</li>
        <li><strong>XX Century:</strong> The majority of Latin American countries have a 48-hour workweek, that is, 8 hours a day, with one day of weekly rest.</li>
        <li><strong>In the mid XX Century:</strong> The minimum working age is starting to increase, with the intention of reducing child labor.</li>
        <li><strong>1980s:</strong> Germany is establishing a 35-hours workweek.</li>
        <li><strong>2018:</strong> A company in New Zealand adopts a 28-hours work week, that is 7 hours a day with 3 days off. The company adopted this schedule after seeing an improvement in productivity.</li>
        <li><strong>2022:</strong> More than 60 companies in the United Kingdom tested a four-day work week for six months. Once the test is finished, They decided to establish it after seeing that it improved the productivity of their employees.</li>
        <li><strong>2023:</strong> Chile reduces its workweek from 45 to 40 hours.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "I think the ideal balance between work and personal life it is achieved in the 35-hours workweek, that is 7 hours a day plus 1 hour of lunch, in other words, a schedule from 9am to 5pm or 8am to 4pm for example, 
          with two days off per week. Even if the tests show that productivity can be increased or even if said productivity is maintained, It would be ideal to have a 32-hours or even 28-hours workweek, 
          This would be equivalent to working 8 hours a day with three days of rest per week for a 32-hours workweek, and 7 hours a day with 3 days of rest for a 28-hours workweek."
